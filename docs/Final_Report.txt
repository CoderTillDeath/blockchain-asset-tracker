A. A short description of our project, to give the context. 

The project is simply an asset tracker similar to what you would find when typing in a tracking number for UPS, USPS, or FedEx.
We are emulating the current system using blockchain technology as a proof of concept.
Our project provides an alternative to package tracking and systems for departure/arrival scans in the transfer of an asset. 
Asset tracking was touted as one of the problems this technology could solve however our sponsor, Faysal, has never seen and actual app developed.




Description below may or may not be needed as it is technical. It is not clear what short description entail but i believe the above provides enough context.
Please remove as y'all see fit.

Our project consists of two applications: 
1. A web app (Angular) is used to display the transactions performed on the blockchain as well as let users view the locations of where transactions were made. 
2. A mobile app (Xamarin) is used to log into an account, and perform transactions into the blockchain. It allows the users to create a property/package and perform releasing/accepting ownership of a package.

Our project uses Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger composer with a web API that handles the communication between the apps and the blockchain.
The blockchain, the web app, and a flask authentication server is hosted on an oracle cloud instance.

B. Details of challenges faced, how they were resolved or not resolved, any workarounds: 

The sponsor originally had hoped that we were able to deploy it on Android and Apple devices, however, none of us had Apple devices so we were unable to develop it for Apple due to it’s requirements. 
Thus, we concentrated our efforts to mainly deploying under Android. Even then it was difficult.
We spent a good few weeks trying to get environmental setup to work correctly. We had many problems trying to get Hyperledger and Visual Studio to work correctly.
Since Hyperledger was relatively new there was little help available online. 
While Visual Studio was relatively straight forward in setting it up, and with plenty of help online, sometimes it would work and other types it wouldn’t. 
Many of the team members had to reinstall Visual Studio and Android SDKs multiple times to get them to function correctly when using Visual Studio.
All the team members had no experience developing with Xamarin and we were using Xamarin forms to develop it as a cross platform app. 
Some of us had some mobile app developing experience but it was not the same as Xamarin mobile development.

Personal methods go here...

If needed we can mention the midterm peer review and the group's opinion on how that was resolved.

=======================================================================================
C. Anything else interesting/significant the team likes to report, lessons learned, etc. 

We were unaware, or perhaps forgotten, about the expiration of our lease on the server. When that went down we ran into a problem with running the app. 
Our app requires a connection to the server to log into and get information from that server to display onto the app. 
So, without the server running we couldn’t get into the app and view our changes to the UI. 
In hindsight we could have set up a way to mock data for the purpose of being able to use the app when the blockchain is down.

While a lot of the merits of this technology is aready realized in cryptocurrency today, not all of these things necessarily translate to the tracking of physical assets.
Our app handles the transfer of virtual packages that are associated with a physical package via a QR code.
We can verify any transactions made by the app but anything involving the physical package is out of our control.
