A. A short description of our project, to give the context. 
Our project provides an alternative to package tracking and and systems for departure/arrival scans in the transfer of an asset. 
It utilizes blockchain technology as a proof of concept. 
Asset tracking was touted as one of the problems this technology could solve however our sponsor, Faysal, has never seen and actual app developed.


Description below may or may not be needed as it is technical. It is not clear what short description entail but i believe the above provides enough context.
Please remove as y'all see fit.

FROM HERE

Our project has two applications available to the user: 
1. A web app (Angular) that lists all transactions made on the blockhain and also shows the location history of any one asset. 
2. A mobile app (Xamarin) that handles the transfer of an asset and shows currently owned assets and past transaction history to the logged in user.

Our blockchain uses Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger composer and there is a web api that handles the communication between our apps and the blockchain.
The blockchain, the web app, and a flask authentication server is hosted on an oracle cloud instance.

B. Details of challenges faced, how they were resolved or not resolved, any workarounds: 
The technologies we chose for the sake of being cross-platform and open source were new to all of our members.

Personal methods go here...

If needed we can mention the midterm peer review and the group's opinion on how that was resolved.

The lease on our instance expiring posed a major challenge to us as without being able to login we could not make UI changes effectively.
In hindsight we could have set up a way to mock data for the purpose of being able to use the app when the blockchain is down.
